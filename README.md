# Quilt POS

This is a toy project to experient with/learn about flask, sqlalchemy, and associated libraries.

It is meant to mimic the functionality of a point-of-sale system that might be used at a quilt shop.

The app is based on Miguel Grinberg's excellent <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Flask tutorial</a>.
